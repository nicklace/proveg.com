            <p>Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) are powerful, top-level tools recommended by the FAO and WHO to meet health and climate goals and form the basis for the development of official food policies as well as nutrition and health programmes. Ideally, they are based on current scientific evidence.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-0">Major issues of current FBDGs</h4>
            <p>Most national dietary guidelines <strong>do not take into account the multiple impacts of food choices and still largely promote animal-based consumption.</strong></p>
            <p>In particular, most dietary guidelines fail to reflect the latest scientific evidence on nutrition and sustainability. </p>

            <p class="big">FBDGs urgently need to become more balanced in their recommendations and therefore become more inclusive in that they consider ethical, ecological, religious and economic aspects that play a role in peopleâ€™s everyday lives. </p>

            <h3>Backed by science</h3>
            <p>The initiative is backed by a <strong>peer-reviewed paper by Anna-Lena Klapp, Nicolas Feil and Antje Risius</strong> that presents a global analysis of national dietary guidelines covering 100 countries regarding their level of encouragement of balanced food choices. The paper is <strong>the most comprehensive cross-country FBDG analysis.</strong></p>
